# PortalTest

Sorry I took this long, I was really trying to get the tasks to toggle on click with the events. Other than not checking if events 
clashed (just didn't get to it), everything else should work (mongoose/mongodb, crud operations, basica display, etc.).

1. start mongod.exe
2. node ./bin./www start
3. go to localhost:3000
4. use the add event button to add more events
5. although not displayed on ui, starttime, endtime, description, and list of tasks are all stored on db (verified with Postman)


Please let me know if anything needs clarification, thanks for the opportunity.
